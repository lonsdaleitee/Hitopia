The complexity of algorithm i make to check balanced bracket is O(n).
where n is length of the string.

1. Algorithm iterates over the string
2. append the stack, compare the character (rune), and slice the stack if necessary

this is the most efficient and easy to understand algorithm for balanced bracket, and i think this is the most efficient algorithm
